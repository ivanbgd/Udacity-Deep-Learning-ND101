# Udacity-Deep-Learning-ND101
These are my solutions to the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation ND101 on-line course.

I have written some examples in C, too, beside Python.

The C code includes my implementations of some matrix and statistics functions. For instance, there are arithmetic and comparison functions.
